/*!
After building `cosmwasm-storage`, we realized many of the design decisions were
limiting us and producing a lot of needless boilerplate. The decision was made to leave
those APIs stable for anyone wanting a very basic abstraction on the KV-store and to
build a much more powerful and complex ORM layer that can provide powerful accessors
using complex key types, which are transparently turned into bytes.

This led to a number of breaking API changes in this package of the course of several
releases as we updated this with lots of experience, user feedback, and deep dives to harness
the full power of generics.

For more information on this package, please check out the
[README](https://github.com/CosmWasm/cw-plus/blob/main/packages/storage-plus/README.md).
